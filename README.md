## How can i get it?

### The cheapest methon in my opinion, is to hand solder this. Buy the pcb off the JLCPCB, its like two dollars on it. For that you need a mini hotplate, You squeeze the Low Melting solder(Like a liquid), place the components - And turn the mini hotplate on. In my opinion - the hardest thing to solder is the screen, its hard to solder to be honest, i dont like soldering flexable cables.
